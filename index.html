    <p><br>“It's ridiculous how strict and limited parking is as a student paying $40,000 a year to go to school here.” Nicole Bendush, a senior undergraduate student, said. </p>
    
    <p>Bendush is expressing a similar concern that majority of students have. In a recent survey of 200 UMD students, 61% of students are unsatisfied with the parking at the University, and 58.9% of students have received a ticket on campus.</p>

    <p>According to the Annual Transportation Report, throughout the course of time, the amount of parking citations has decreased by thousands, it is still at a high rate of 55,143 citations for the 2016 school year. The average parking ticket cost $75 if paid on time. Resulting in DOTS parking industry making around 4 million dollars on parking tickets alone.</p>

    <p>The annual report shows that out of the 55,143 parking citations handed out, 14,361 of those citations were appealed. The appeal process is something a person can go through if they believe they were wrongfully ticketed. From the 14,361 voided citations, majority of those appealed are faculty members. 55.6% of students are denied when trying to argue their case against a ticket, whereas 5.3% of faculty members are declined the appeal. </p>

    <p><br>The alarmingly high rates of parking citations may normally encourage students to walk to class rather than use their vehicle. 
	However, approximately 58% of students live off-campus, and majority of faculty members need to drive to work. 
	In addition to students and faculty members, UMD offers inadequate places to park for visitors. 
	From our 200-student survey, 58.19% found difficult to find a place for their visitors to park on campus, specifically a cost-free place. 
	</p>
    
	<p>There are no lots on campus that advertise free parking. Most lots require a permit, which is $250, to park, or are not available for free use until after 4 PM. The parking garages on campus charge individuals $3 per hour to park.

	<p>“It is very difficult to have visitors at Maryland because of parking. Visitors don't have a reasonable lot that they can pay for to park their cars overnight.” Laura Mayhew, a senior undergraduate student, said.</p>
    
    <p>Over the past year, DOTS has had a major loss of campus parking spaces due to the construction of new buildings and hotels that are coming to the university. Additionally, President Loh made a carbon neutrality pledge, and therefore is trying to sway students away from using vehicles on campus. By 2018, it is estimated that the campus will lose approximately 2,000 parking spots. </p>
    
    
    <p>In efforts to replace the disintegration of parking spots, DOTS has started a bikeshare program called mBike. This program has over 125 bikes and 12 stations between College Park and the UMD campus. The system works so that students may travel from destination to destination in a more eco-friendly way, without the burden of finding a parking spot or potentially receiving a ticket. </p>
    
    <p>DOTs staff wants students and faculty to think outside the box when making their way to campus.</p>
    
   <p> "Instead of driving, people could carpool and save a parking space," said Anna McLaughlin, DOTS assistant director. "They save money, it opens up a little more parking, and it's a win-win for everybody. I think as the larger construction projects happen, we are going to be doing a lot more marketing and outreach to talk to people — both students and employees — about their other alternatives from driving alone."</p>
    
    <p>Although many students express disatisfaction with DOTS Services, the transportation unit believes these efforts will help the campus tremendously in terms of sustainability. </p>
